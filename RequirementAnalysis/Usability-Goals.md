# USABILITY GOALS
## Buy and sell quickly and securely
We want our users to sell or purchase used items with as few clicks as possible, while maintaining quality and secure transactions.
## Simple UI
We want to build a website with a simple and highly intuitive user interface. Everything is well labeled and within reach, so our users should be able to navigate back and forth without any complications or hiccups.
## Speed is of the essence
This website will be built using Django and PostgreSQL so we want to make sure that everything is fast and keep loading times to an absolute minimum.
