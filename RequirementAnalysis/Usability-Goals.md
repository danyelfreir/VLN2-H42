# USABILITY GOALS
## Designed for busy people
We understand that young parents and other busy people do not have the time to type on their phone all day or wait for people to reply. That's why our system automates the most tedious parts of online selling and lets the person confirm sales or purchases when they see fit.
## Buy and sell quickly and securely
We want our users to sell or purchase used items with as few clicks as possible, while maintaining quality and secure transactions.
## Simple UI
We want to build a website with a simple and highly intuitive user interface. Everything is well labeled and within reach, so our users should be able to navigate back and forth without any complications or hiccups.
## Speed is of the essence
This website will be built using Django and PostgreSQL so we want to make sure that everything is fast and keep loading times to an absolute minimum.
